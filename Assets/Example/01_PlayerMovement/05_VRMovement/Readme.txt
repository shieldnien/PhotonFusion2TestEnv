The sample project is tested on Oculus platform (Oculus Link is also supported). To run the project on your headset, please follow these steps:

1. Use VRMovement as default scene / move it to first position in Build Settings. This is the only scene configured to work with VR.
2. Open Project Settings => XR Plug-in Management.
    - Enable Initialize XR on Startup.
    - Enable Oculus provider (or any other you want to test).
3. Play.
