- Fixed rotation of AnimatedPlatform in shared mode.
- AnimatedPlatform now uses full-precision position and rotation synchronization.
- Updated KCC addon to 2.0.10.

Version 2.0.11
- Added SortedUpdateInvoker.
    - Provides deferred execution of update callbacks scheduled by SortedUpdateInvoker.ScheduleSortedUpdate().
    - Callbacks are sorted by order passed as parameter in schedule method.
- ExpertPlayer now uses SortedUpdateInvoker to process input actions in order, sorted by ExpertInput.LocalAlpha (except default 0.0f which defer execution to the end).
    - This can be used to fire render-accurate lag compensated casts and preserve realtime order of actions.

- Updated KCC addon to 2.0.9.
- Updated Fusion SDK to 2.0.0 RC5 Build 824.
- Updated Fusion Menu to 2.0.0 RC5 Build 824.

Version 2.0.10
- Added interpolation data to ExpertInput required for render-accurate lag compensated casts.
- ExpertPlayerInput refactoring related to actions deferring (used for render-predicted movement to be more consistent with fixed simulation movement).
- Move direction size in ExpertPlayerInput is now recalculated after all ticks to match remaining delta time between FUN() and following Render().
- Processing of device input moved from ExpertPlayerInput.cs to corresponding partial classes.
- ExpertInput.RenderAlpha renamed to ExpertInput.LocalAlpha (the value equals to Runner.LocalAlpha).
- Updated project to Unity 2021.3.36f1.

Version 2.0.9
- Added tick-aligned look rotation accumulation to Basic, Advanced and Top-Down movement samples.
- Updated Physics addon to 2.0.0.
- Updated KCC addon to 2.0.8.

Version 2.0.8
- Exposed movement and input action methods in FirstPersonExpertPlayer and ThirdPersonExpertPlayer to derived classes.
- Renamed methods in derived ExpertPlayer classes to better indicate execution order.
- Added ExpertInput.RenderAlpha.
    - This property is set on client after pressing mouse button.
    - Equals to Runner.LocalAlpha.
    - Can be used on state authority to get camera position at the time of client Render() in which mouse button was pressed.
- Processing device input for current frame is now triggered from first of the following methods (originally processed in IBeforeUpdate):
    - OnInput callback.
    - Render().
    - Update().
- Added SetFixedInput() / SetAccumulatedInput() / SetRenderInput() back to ExpertPlayerInput.
- ExpertPlayerInput - added one frame delay for actions detected when processing device input from OnInput callback. This is to match input render alpha with time of following Render().
- ThirdPersonExpertPlayer camera now follows KCC prediction/interpolation settings for look rotation.
- Added new LagCompensation debug scene for testing camera handle (child transform of KCC) position/rotation used as the origin for render accurate lag compensated casts.
- Fixed look rotation delta polling in ExpertPlayerInput. Now the resulting look rotation is always aligned with tick timing.
- Fixed layers and KCC configuration for PlayerBase and NPCBase prefabs.
- Updated KCC addon to 2.0.7.

Version 2.0.7
- Removed replication example.
- Improved NavMesh NPC to find new waypoint after getting stuck.
